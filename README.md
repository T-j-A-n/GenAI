#Linguistic integration
We planned of using Bhashini API, to convert speech to text of hindi, telugu, kannada and marathi.<br>
The user can respond to it, and it will access the accuracy of the answer and define how well-versed they are in the language.<br>
This includes reading(out to the recorder) and  speaking( to the Bhashini GenAI speech-to-text recognizer)<br>
We couldn't get the Bhashini API on time, hence we have no output.
#Numerical understanding
Several math questions, will be structured as a word problem in the user’s preferred language, and the score of their correct answers will estimate their aptitude.<br>
OpenAI’s GPTneo-125m will be used to do so, the questions will be randomly generated from prompts, so the answer is authentic.<br>
